Dear Researcher, 
Thanks for reaching out to us. You can check the number of values in your files by using the word count (wc) command in bash. 
By using the following the wc command you can determine the number of values in all your files:
wc values*

To quickly determine the number of files with less than 100 values, you can simply write a bash script to print only outputs with values less than 100 as shown in the attached bash script (Select_Values.sh).
#!/bin/bash
for f in values*; do
if test "$( wc -w < "$f" )" -lt "100"
then 
    echo "$f"
fi
done

First, you simply use the 'for loop' to loop through all the values files. Using the wild card (*) in the filename helps you to execute a command on all files begining with 'values'.
You can then use the 'if' statement in the second line to test if the number of values in any of the files is less than 100. 
This file is then printed to the screen by using the echo command. 

Hope this makes sense. Feel free to contact me if anything is unclear. 

Regards, 
Michael.
