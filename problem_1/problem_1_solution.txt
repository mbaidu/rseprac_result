Dear Researcher, 
Thanks for reaching out to us. I have renamed the files back to .dat as seen in the folder. 
You can always simply rename your files by using the bash command: 
mv filename.csv filename.dat

As you need to do this for multiple files, you can use the wild card (*) in a for loop to help you rename all the files as seen in the attached bash script (Rename_datafile.sh).

#!/bin/bash
for f in *.csv; do
    mv -- "$f" "${f%.csv}.dat"
done

Always feel free to reach out to me whenever you need any further assistance. 

Regards, 
Michael.
