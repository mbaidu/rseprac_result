Dear Researcher, 
Thanks for reaching out. To acquire your requested data, I will need some information from you. 
May I know the period you will need the data for, the demography or specific variables of interest and finally, the keywords needed to idenfify the content we need. Also, I would be grateful if you could point out any confidentiality or ethical issues to be considered in this task. 
Determining the period is important for me to define the time bounds of my search. Specifying the variables of interest will help me clearly determine the specific parameters relevant for your research as well as estimate the volume of the data to be collected. This will also help to estimate how much memory will be needed. Providing the keywords will also be helpful to constrain my search. 

Hope to hear back from you soon. 

Regards,
Michael.
